UPDATE Ailments set article = "Eye Strain (Computer Vision Syndrome)
It looks like your eyes might be feeling the strain from all that screen time. Computer Vision Syndrome, or Digital Eye Strain, is common these days, affecting anyone who spends hours in front of screens for work, gaming, or browsing. Symptoms include blurry vision, dry eyes, headaches, and trouble focusing.
When you‚Äôre glued to a screen, your blink rate drops, making your eyes dry and irritated. Digital screens are also harder to focus on than printed text, with factors like glare, poor lighting, and incorrect screen distance making things worse.
Don‚Äôt worry, though. There are simple steps you can take to feel better. 
Follow the 20-20-20 rule where every 20 minutes you look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. Keep your monitor 20 to 24 inches away with the top at or just below eye level and adjust the brightness to your environment. Reduce glare by using curtains, adjusting lighting, or adding a matte screen filter. Adjust text settings by increasing the font size and tweaking the contrast. Consider blue light filters or glasses, especially in the evening to prevent sleep disruption. Remember to blink more often and use artificial tears if your eyes feel dry. Finally, visit your eye doctor regularly to keep your vision healthy and get personalized advice."

/*UPDATE Ailments set article = "Tension Headaches
Ah, it sounds like you might be dealing with tension headaches. They‚Äôre pretty common, especially if you‚Äôre spending a lot of time at your desk or in front of screens. The pain often feels dull and achy, starting around your forehead or the back of your head, and can spread down into your neck and shoulders.
Poor posture, eye strain, or stress can make the muscles around your neck and scalp tense up, causing that familiar, uncomfortable ache. Sitting hunched over your screen or feeling stressed only makes things worse.
Don‚Äôt worry! There are several simple steps you can take to feel better.
Check Your Posture. Sit upright, with your back supported and your screen at eye level.
Take Breaks. Stand up and stretch every 30-60 minutes. Even a short walk helps!
Relax Those Muscles. Gentle neck stretches and shoulder rolls can work wonders.
Manage Stress. Deep breathing or listening to calming music can make a difference.
Stay Hydrated. Drinking enough water can help prevent headaches, too.
If these headaches become frequent or intense, it might be time to talk to a healthcare provider."
WHERE id = 12;*/

/*UPDATE Ailments set article = "Cervical Strain (Neck Pain)
Oh no, neck pain can really be a bother. Cervical strain, often caused by poor posture like hunching over your screen or looking down at your phone, puts a lot of extra strain on your neck muscles. Think of your head as a heavy bowling ball; when it‚Äôs not properly aligned, your neck works overtime, leading to stiffness and pain that can radiate to your shoulders or upper back. Sometimes, it can even trigger tension headaches.
There are steps you can take to reduce the pain. Fix your posture by keeping your screen at eye level and your shoulders relaxed. Make sure your back is supported and your feet are flat on the floor. Try neck stretches, like tilting your head side to side, bringing your chin to your chest, or doing gentle shoulder rolls to loosen tight muscles. Strengthen your neck with chin tucks to engage and support those muscles. Remember to take breaks and move around regularly; even a short walk can make a big difference.
Applying heat or ice can also help. Use a heating pad to relax muscles or ice to reduce inflammation. And don‚Äôt forget to keep your phone at eye level to prevent extra neck strain. If your neck pain persists or gets worse, consult a healthcare professional. Sometimes, a little extra help or physical therapy can make all the difference."

/*UPDATE Ailments set article = "Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ)
It sounds like you‚Äôre feeling some discomfort in your jaw, which might be due to a TMJ disorder. TMJ stands for the temporomandibular joint, connecting your jawbone to your skull. When this joint isn‚Äôt working smoothly, you may notice pain, clicking sounds, or difficulty chewing and talking.
TMJ issues are often triggered by stress, teeth grinding, or jaw clenching, especially during intense focus like gaming marathons or stressful work sessions. The muscles around your jaw can become tense, causing anything from a dull ache to sharp discomfort. Sometimes, your jaw might feel tight or get stuck.
Don‚Äôt worry, there are ways to relieve TMJ discomfort. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga can ease muscle tension. Jaw stretches and massages, like gently opening and closing your mouth or massaging the jaw muscles, can help reduce stiffness. If you grind your teeth at night, a custom mouth guard from your dentist can protect your jaw. Warm compresses can relax muscles, while cold packs reduce swelling and numb pain.
To prevent further issues, keep your jaw relaxed by having your teeth slightly apart and lips together. Avoid chewing gum or hard foods, and be mindful of your posture, since slouching can add stress to your jaw and neck. If the pain doesn‚Äôt improve or disrupts your daily life, consider seeing a healthcare professional. TMJ disorders are manageable, so hang in there. You‚Äôve got this!"

/*UPDATE Ailments set article = "Upper Crossed Syndrome
Hmm, it sounds like you might be dealing with something called Upper Crossed Syndrome. If you‚Äôve noticed that your shoulders are rounded or your head leans forward, this could be the culprit. It‚Äôs super common, especially if you‚Äôre spending hours sitting or working at a screen.

Upper Crossed Syndrome happens when your upper body muscles are out of balance: your chest and neck muscles become tight and overactive, while your upper back and shoulder muscles get weak and underused. Picture it like a tug-of-war between muscles that throws your posture out of whack, leading to that classic 'hunched' look. Over time, this can cause discomfort, headaches, or neck strain. Let me take you through some signs to look for. 
Rounded Shoulders. Your shoulders slouch, curving your upper back.
Forward Head Posture. Your head juts forward, straining your neck.
Chest Tightness. A feeling of restriction in your chest muscles.
Upper Back Weakness. Fatigue or soreness in your upper back, especially after sitting.
There are methods you can do to improve it.
Proper Sitting Posture. Sit with your back straight, shoulders back, and head aligned with your spine. Keep your feet flat and your screen at eye level.
Strengthen Your Back: Do exercises like rows and scapular squeezes to activate your upper back muscles.
Stretch Your Chest: Stand in a doorway, extend your arms, and lean forward gently to open up your chest.
If your symptoms persist, seeing a physical therapist or chiropractor can help. Remember, small adjustments can make a big difference in your posture and overall comfort!"

Shoulder feeling sore or weak? It might be shoulder impingement syndrome, which often comes from overusing your shoulder muscles. Like when you‚Äôre gaming, working long hours on your computer, or frequently lifting your arms. You might notice pain when raising your arm or even a sense of weakness in your shoulder.

This happens because the tendons in your shoulder can get irritated or compressed from repetitive movements, causing inflammation and discomfort. Your posture can make it worse, especially if your shoulders are hunched forward.
There are some simple steps you can take to feel better.
Strengthen Your Rotator Cuff. Exercises focused on your rotator cuff can help stabilize and support your shoulder joint.
Improve Your Posture. Keep your shoulders back and down and adjust your workspace so your arms aren‚Äôt strained.
Take Breaks. Give your shoulders a rest by taking regular breaks to stretch and relax your muscles.
If the pain doesn‚Äôt go away or gets worse, consider seeing a healthcare professional. They can help you develop a personalized plan to get your shoulder feeling strong again!"
